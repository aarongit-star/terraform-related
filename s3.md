Step 1: Create Module Directory
Create a directory for your module. Inside this directory, you'll structure your module with the necessary Terraform files.

plaintext
Copy code
s3-frontend-module/
|-- main.tf
|-- variables.tf
|-- outputs.tf
Step 2: Write main.tf
In main.tf, define the AWS resources needed for your S3 bucket. For a frontend deployment, this typically includes an S3 bucket and a bucket policy.

hcl
Copy code
```
provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}


provider "aws" {
  region = var.region
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket" "frontend_bucket" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
  acl    = "public-read"

  website {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "error.html"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "frontend_bucket_policy" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.frontend_bucket.bucket

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow",
        Principal = "*",
        Action = "s3:GetObject",
        Resource = "${aws_s3_bucket.frontend_bucket.arn}/*",
      },
    ],
  })
}


resource "aws_s3_bucket" "frontend_bucket" {
  bucket = var.bucket_name
  acl    = "public-read"

  website {
    index_document = "index.html"
    error_document = "error.html"
  }
}

resource "aws_s3_bucket_policy" "frontend_bucket_policy" {
  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.frontend_bucket.bucket

  policy = jsonencode({
    Version = "2012-10-17",
    Statement = [
      {
        Effect = "Allow",
        Principal = "*",
        Action = "s3:GetObject",
        Resource = "${aws_s3_bucket.frontend_bucket.arn}/*",
      },
    ],
  })
}
```
Step 3: Write variables.tf
Define the input variables that users of your module will provide. In this example, we need the region and bucket_name.

hcl
Copy code
variable "region" {
  description = "AWS region"
}

variable "bucket_name" {
  description = "Name for the S3 bucket"
}
Step 4: Write outputs.tf
Define the outputs that users of your module might find useful. In this case, we'll output the S3 bucket name and website endpoint.

hcl
Copy code
output "bucket_name" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.frontend_bucket.bucket
}

output "website_endpoint" {
  value = aws_s3_bucket.frontend_bucket.website_endpoint
}
Step 5: Use the Module
Now you can use your module in a separate Terraform configuration. Create a directory for this configuration, and create a main.tf file:

plaintext
Copy code
frontend-deployment/
|-- main.tf
|-- variables.tf
|-- terraform.tfvars
main.tf in frontend-deployment/
hcl
Copy code
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

module "frontend" {
  source = "../s3-frontend-module"

  region      = "us-east-1"
  bucket_name = "your-unique-frontend-bucket-name"
}
variables.tf in frontend-deployment/
hcl
Copy code
variable "region" {
  description = "AWS region"
}

variable "bucket_name" {
  description = "Name for the S3 bucket"
}
terraform.tfvars in frontend-deployment/
hcl
Copy code
region      = "us-east-1"
bucket_name = "your-unique-frontend-bucket-name"
Step 6: Run Terraform
Now you can run Terraform commands in the frontend-deployment/ directory:

bash
Copy code
terraform init
terraform apply
This will create the S3 bucket for hosting your frontend code.

Notes:
Replace placeholder values like "your-unique-frontend-bucket-name" with your actual values.
Adapt the module to include any additional configurations you need, such as logging, versioning, or encryption.
Ensure that the AWS credentials you are using with Terraform have the necessary permissions to create S3 buckets.
Remember to handle sensitive information, such as AWS credentials, securely in your Terraform configurations and use best practices for managing state files.
